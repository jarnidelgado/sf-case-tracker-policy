📄 Privacy Policy — SF Case Tracker

Last updated: December 2025

SF Case Tracker is a Chrome extension designed for internal organizational use to help agents log Salesforce case activity into a Google Sheets spreadsheet owned and managed by the organization.

We take privacy extremely seriously.
This extension does not collect, sell, share, or store personal data from users or from website visitors.

1. Information the extension accesses

SF Case Tracker only accesses:

1.1. Your Google account basic profile (email and name)

This is obtained exclusively through Chrome’s chrome.identity API to authenticate your Google Sheets access.
This allows the extension to write new rows to a Google Sheet using your own account.

The extension does not access your emails, contacts, files, or any other Google data.

1.2. Salesforce case fields visible on screen

To assist with auto-filling fields, the extension reads:

Case Number

Contact Reason

These fields are already visible on the Salesforce webpage and are not transmitted anywhere except to the Google Sheet where the agent logs the case.

2. What the extension does NOT collect

The extension does not collect or store:

Browsing history

Personal communications

User activity (keystrokes, clicks, scrolling)

Credentials or authentication data

Location

Sensitive personal data

Any information about Salesforce customers/users beyond what the agent logs manually

3. How data is used

Data is logged into a Google Sheet owned and controlled by the user's organization.

The extension performs no independent data storage beyond local Chrome storage for functional settings (theme, daily counters).

The extension does not transfer data to third parties.

4. Data Sharing

We do not sell, share, or transfer user data to third parties.
All logged data stays within the organization's Google Workspace environment.

5. Permissions Justification

The extension uses:

identity to authenticate with Google Sheets

storage to store local extension preferences

scripting to read visible fields within Salesforce pages

host permissions to call Google Sheets API and read Salesforce UI

These permissions are strictly limited to the extension's functionality.
